This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle\u0027s algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get client.writer.batch-size worth of rows for a bucket it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this bucket we will delay for the specified time waiting for more records to show up.
