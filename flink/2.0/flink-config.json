Thus, the receiver back-pressures the sender. The streaming mode always uses this exchange. With blocking exchanges, upstream and downstream tasks run in stages. Records are persisted to some storage between stages. Downstream tasks then fetch these records after the upstream tasks finished. Such an exchange reduces the resources required to execute the job as it does not need to run upstream and downstream tasks simultaneously. With hybrid exchanges (experimental), downstream tasks can run anytime as long as upstream tasks start running. When given sufficient resources, it can reduce the overall job execution time by running tasks simultaneously. Otherwise, it also allows jobs to be executed with very little resources. It adapts to custom preferences between persisting less data and restarting less tasks on failures, by providing different spilling strategies. Possible values: \"ALL_EXCHANGES_PIPELINED\": Upstream and downstream tasks run simultaneously. This leads to lower latency and more evenly distributed (but higher) resource usage across tasks. \"ALL_EXCHANGES_BLOCKING\": Upstream and downstream tasks run subsequently. This reduces the resource usage as downstream tasks are started after upstream tasks finished. \"ALL_EXCHANGES_HYBRID_FULL\": Downstream can start running anytime, as long as the upstream has started.

Some commonly used compression algorithms for candidates include NO_COMPRESSION ,SNAPPY_COMPRESSION and LZ4_COMPRESSION. The default value is SNAPPY_COMPRESSION, which means that all data uses the Snappy compression algorithm. Likewise, if set to NO_COMPRESSION , means that all data is not compressed, which will achieve faster speed but will bring some space amplification. In addition, if we need to consider both spatial amplification and performance, we can also set it to \u0027NO_COMPRESSION;NO_COMPRESSION;LZ4_COMPRESSION\u0027, which means that L0 and L1 data will not be compressed, and other data will be compressed using LZ4. Possible values: \"NO_COMPRESSION\" \"SNAPPY_COMPRESSION\" \"ZLIB_COMPRESSION\" \"BZLIB2_COMPRESSION\" \"LZ4_COMPRESSION\" \"LZ4HC_COMPRESSION\" \"XPRESS_COMPRESSION\" \"ZSTD_COMPRESSION\" \"DISABLE_COMPRESSION_OPTION\""
